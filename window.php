	<h2 class= "baba"> Tips for playing </h2>
	<p> 1. To get good touch in your strumming hand, it'll take longer than 10 hours. It's about reps baby. Try to consider the amout of finesse you are hitting the strongs with. Do a little research on palm mutting and other useful strumming techniques. If it sounds nasty at first, that's cool. Your fingers and wrists will start to adjust. Focus on getting quality sounds out of the guitar. <br> <br>

	2. With your left hand, fret the strings as close to the frets as possible. This will reduce buzzing and the chords will ring clearer. <br> <br>

	3. You'll need to press the strings down firmly to ensure they ring out well. One of the toughest parts for beginners is ensuring you aren't "mutting" the strings that you aren't fretting. These small touches get programmed in to your fingers after hours of time, so don't worry too much about it. Just focus on getting the best sound out of your guitar. <br> <br>

	4. Your fingers will hurt, don't worry about it too much. <br> <br>

	5. It'll feel weird for the first few days. This is normal. At the beginning a G chord feels like it was purpose designed to give you wrist cramps, after a month of playing the guitar it'll feel like coming home. <br> <br>
