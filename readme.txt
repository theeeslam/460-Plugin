Welcome to the popup plugin.

This popup is designed to give your website a more detailed
way of presenting a product.

The plugin works in this way:

1. Install the plugin via the Wordpress plugins menu

2. You should see a custom section on the left side of your screen named "The Popup"

3. When you click the popup you should see a new page with three fields
	- The first field is the Width of your popup in pixels
	- The second field is the Height of your popup in pixels
	- The third field is the paragraph content for the popup

4. If you click the "Save Changes button once you have entered in values and text,
	the numbers will be saved to the options menu

5. If you click the "Create the Window" button, a sample window will be created

6. The plugin works in a way that it hooks on the the load process of a page

7. You can open the window.css file and the window.html file to edit the popup completly

8. To enter the shortcode for the plugin, you can enter in the custom word 'welp'
	to extract the shortcode onto the desired wp page. By entering the 
	custom word into []square brackets onto the desired page, users are able to
	activate the shortcode.
		EXAMPLE: [welp] shortcode [/welp]

- As of a certain point, we were having struggles with the header. It was giving us an error
	we put the shortcode in a seperate plugin by itself as proof that we can make it. The 
	plugin by itself is called shortcode and it is included on the ccit2656 page. We can
	hand that in on request.
